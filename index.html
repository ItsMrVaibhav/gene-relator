                Gene Relator is a software capable of comparing gene sequences of organisms such as humans, apes, fishes, etc. and computing several essencial 
                results about the organisms. The results computed can further be used to infer similarity between organisms and understand their evolutionary relationships.

            Gene Relator is a software dedicated to compare gene sequences of various organisms, compute essencial results, and find similarity between the organisms.
            <br><br>
            Before we proceed to the details about the software, let's talk about some general points that are necessary in terms of understanding this software's functionality.
            <ul>
                <li>Evolution refers to biological and physical changes in biological populations over a very long period of time.</li>
                <li>There are five major causes of evolution - Natural Selection, Mutations, Genetic Drift, Gene Flow, and Non-Random Mating.</li>
                <li>Natural Selection refers to the process where biological populations adapt and change based on the environmental conditions. These conditions may include climate, location, weather, surroundings, etc.</li>
                <li>Mutations refer to changes in the DNA sequence. These changes can be point changes or maybe in bulk changes. Mutations can be both harmful and helpful because they directly alter the functioning of an organism. Although, there are a few more factors that control the express of these mutations.</li>
                <li>DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid) is the self-replicating genetic material of almost all the organisms, except for few viruses.</li>
                <li>A DNA has a double helical structure where two anti-paralle strands wrap around each other. These strands are held together by hydrogren bonds present between Adenine and Thymine base pairs, and Cytosine and Guanine base pairs.</li>
                <li>Adenine and Thymine base pairs have two hydrogen bonds between them. While, Cytosine and Guanine have three hydrogen bonds between them.</li>
                <li>Adenine and Guanine are Purines while Cytosine and Thymine are Pyrimidines.</li>
                <li>A DNA is made up of nucleotides which are further composed of a phosphate group, a sugar group, and one of the four nitrogenous bases, namely, Adenine, Guanine, Cytosine, and Thymine. </li>
                <li>A DNA consists of genes which are responsible for the making proteins for an organism.</li>
                <li>A RNA (Ribonucleic acid) is a single stranded molecule that is also made up of nucleotides. These nucleotides include one of the four nitrogenous bases, namely Adenine, Guanine, Cytosine, and Uracil.</li>
                <li>Like Thymine, Uracil is also a pyrimidine.</li>
                <li>Unlike DNA, RNA is not self-replicating. It is synthesized from DNA in the process of transcription.</li>
                <li>Interestingly, RNA is the first genetic material because like DNA, it is capable of storing and preserving genetic information of an organism and is capable of catalyzing chemical reactions.</li>
                <li>Still, RNA can be found to be the genetic material of a few viruses.</li>
                <li>Adenine - Uracil and Cytosine - Guanine base pairing can be found in RNA.</li>
                <li>RNA is responsible for the production of proteins in the process of translation.</li>
                <li>A genome is an organisms genetic code that contains information needed to maintain, grow, and develop an organism.</li>
                <li> A genome is made up DNA.</li>
            </ul>

            Now that we are through with the basic knowledge, let's talk about the software. 
            <br><br>
            Currently, the database of this software has gene sequences of 20 organisms. More sequences can be added anytime in order to scale the software.
